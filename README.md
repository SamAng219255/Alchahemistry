# Alchahemistry
An old project I planned to build but didn't have time. I may return to this later.
The basic premise was an in-browser top-down game with procedural equipment and the ability to procedurally combine equipment into different (hopefully improved) equipment. Project so far has very little, just a js sprite-loader and really basic tiling program.
